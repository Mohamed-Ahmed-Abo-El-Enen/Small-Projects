I love my men,\" the AFP news agency quotes Ousman Badjie as saying.\\nHowever, he has little influence over an elite unit of fighters, called the Gambia National Guard, who may opt to fight even if vastly outnumbered by the Senegalese and Nigerian forces as they are from the same ethnic group as Mr Jammeh. The Gambia's armed forces is said to number 2,500.\\nOne key question is how ordinary Gambians see the Senegalese troops if they do cross the border. The Gambia and Senegal are made up of the same ethnic groups which were divided by colonial borders, so they speak the same languages and share the same culture.\\nHowever, a fierce rivalry has developed between the two nations, with many Gambians feeling they are looked down on by their more numerous, French-speaking neighbours.\\nSo while supporters of Mr Barrow will presumably see any intervention favourably, there is also a danger that it could be seen as a foreign invasion force.\\nWhy is Mr Barrow in Senegal?\\nMr Barrow, a property developer who has never held public office, has been in Senegal since the weekend following an invitation to attend a summit of African leaders who back his victory.\\nHe did not even go back home when his eight-year-old son died after being mauled by a dog.

To discuss practical ways to \"renew the capitalist system\".\\nThe Prince of Wales, former US President Bill Clinton, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney are among the speakers at the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism.\\nSo what should capitalism actually do?\\nThe BBC has gathered a range of viewpoints on the subject.\\nCapitalism has to prove to society at large that it is a forest for general prosperity and dynamic growth. Because of the scandals of the last five years and because of the growing inequality, it is up to business to prove that what is good for society is good for business.\\nThe onus is on us now in the business and investing community.\\nInclusive capitalism is really no different from conscious capitalism or progressive capitalism. It is an effort to convey that capitalism is part of a broad-based improvement for all of society, that it doesn't stand alone. Inclusive capitalism is good capitalism.\\nBad capitalism is rigging Libor rates, it's selling instruments that are improper investments for your investor, it's taking advantage of workers, it's not caring about the sustainability of your supply chain. There are lots of things that are bad capitalism.\\nLady de Rothschild - Inclusive Capitalism Initiative\\nThat's why we have such low confidence from the public at large in capitalism, because for too long we who are in business allowed bad behaviour. We have to acknowledge we have done some things wrong.\\nOne of my main objectives in being the founder and co-host of the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism was to bring investors into a room, so that investors can decide that they're going to go to management and ask for more than just return on equity.\\nThey're going to ask management how are you making sure that your supply chain will last? How are you engaging with your community so that you are still admired and valued by your community?\\nIf investors say we are only going to put our money in companies that have a long-term view towards society then, surprise surprise, the corporations will behave that way. So our time horizon is 20 years not 12 weeks. That's the immediate objective.\\nOnly an economic culture which has ceased to care about future generations could sacrifice so lightly the interests of people far away in geography or in time, and the long-term flourishing of the earth.\\nIf capitalism is about value, not just cost, it would factor in the interests of our grandchildren and their grandchildren, who will rely on what we research, invest in and commit to now. Earlier capitalists invested and built for a future they would not themselves see.\\nWe are that future - but capitalism has become careless about handing enough on for those after us.\\nBut, replies the capitalist, \"Capitalism only reflects its surrounding culture. Don't blame me if a short-term culture begets short-term capitalism.\"\\nCapitalism is usually too modest about its impact - and too quick to disclaim responsibility. We have lived so long with capitalism that it has taught us who we are and how to behave - but its anthropology is too thin to teach us to live well.\\nRev Dr Malcolm Brown - Church of England\\nCapitalism is a complex of ideas and practices in tension with each other. The creativity of that tension has given the world innumerable good things. But the tension is inherently unstable and today's global capitalism has traded creative tension for unstable short termism.\\nFor instance, Adam Smith knew that market capitalism relies on a shared social morality (to secure things like trust) which capitalism does nothing to create or sustain.\\nCapitalism actually benefits from externals which it devalues. Similarly, free competition is a basic condition for functioning markets - yet without external constraint, legal or moral, capitalism tends toward monopolies and cartels (as we have seen in banking).\\nSo maintaining the tensions means valuing things which capitalism does not value - like moral communities, legal restraints and the interests of people now outside the marketplace. Only by holding those tensions can capitalism realise its promise and not degenerate into a threat.\\nThe most urgent need is for capitalism to recover the idea of intergenerational justice -  believing that your great great grandchildren are worth investing in today.\\nWhen people forgo current pleasures and invest instead, hoping to gain by providing goods and services people might want in future, we call it capitalism.\\nIt has generated the wealth that has lifted large parts of humankind from subsistence and starvation, and has enabled us to fund life-saving medicine, education and the arts, as well as opportunities and material comforts.\\nJust as democracy can be corrupted by repressive populism, so can capitalism be perverted by \"rent-seeking\" - when people seek to gain more than the goods and services they produce are worth to others.\\nSometimes they use political influence to sustain monopolies or to prevent new entrants and innovators from competing for custom. Sometimes they use governments to provide subsidies from taxpayers, or to prohibit cheaper imports.\\nDr Madsen Pirie - Adam Smith Institute\\nSometimes they do deals with governments that provide taxpayer funds to cushion losses derived from incompetence or recklessness. These forms of crony capitalism detract from capitalism's real benefits and achievements.\\nWhat capitalism should now do is to free itself from these rent-seeking perversions and spread its benefits as widely as possible.\\nIt should act against anti-competitive practices to give people instead the power of free choices between competing goods and services.  It should spread ownership of capital and investment as widely as possible through such things as personal pensions and individual savings accounts.\\nIt should lower the barriers to entry so that everyone can aspire to start up a business to bring goods and services to others.  It should seek a tax system that rewards success rather than punishing it.\\nCapitalism should become inclusive, making it as easy and as attractive as possible for as many as possible to set aside some part of present consumption in order to invest some of their resources and their time in providing goods and services that others will want. It should become true capitalism.\\nA 2011 study in the New Scientist revealed that 147 \"super entities\" control 40% of 43,060 transnational corporations and 60% of their revenues. The study was based on shareholders and directors but doesn't reveal beneficial ownership and control hidden behind nominee companies, trusts and foundations. Evidence suggests power is even more concentrated than the study indicates.\\nThis stateless power dominates politics, media and education. Financial capitalism seeks to monetise and control everything, influencing legislation and regulation in its favour.\\nStateless power is drawn from three fundamental flaws in the economic system, evolved to benefit the ruling class over centuries, but these flaws have been expunged from economic discourse:\\nCritical Thinking\\nFlaw 1. Private capture of the value of land, resources and other commons (such as water, the radio spectrum, genes, nature and knowledge), gifts from nature (or God), the value of which is communally created. The value of these must be shared for the good of all to fund public services and an unconditional citizens dividend.\\nFlaw 2. Interest on money creates no wealth but systemically drives inequality, environmental destruction, conflict and exponential, unsustainable debt growth. Debt must be unenforceable in law and usury (lending money at interest) illegal. Debt must revert to a social construct rather than its current role of facilitating wealth extraction, exploitation and oppression.\\nFlaw 3. Increased mechanisation and technology has rendered full employment unachievable, unnecessary and undesirable. The means to life cannot be conditional on paid employment but is a right for all and must be provided in the form of an unconditional citizens dividend sufficient for a decent life.</td>\n","      <td>Men and women who hold some $30 trillion (Â£17.8 trillion) of assets under management - that's one third of the world's investable assets - will gather in London on Tuesday.</td>\n","      <td>27517577</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["metric"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"skJ0khsh2ao6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683407538734,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Mohamed Ahmed","userId":"10238096518286057894"}},"outputId":"096acfad-d773-4d63-e8df-cd9fc627b110"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Metric(name: \"rouge\", features: {'predictions': Value(dtype='string', id='sequence'), 'references': Value(dtype='string', id='sequence')}, usage: \"\"\"\n","Calculates average rouge scores for a list of hypotheses and references\n","Args:\n","    predictions: list of predictions to score.
